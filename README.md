 Project Overview:-

This project uses a dataset of movie titles to recommend similar movies. It employs:

- TF-IDF vectorization** for representing movie titles as numerical data
- Cosine similarity** to compare the similarity between movie titles
- An **interactive search box** (with `ipywidgets`) for dynamic user input (works in Jupyter and Google Colab)

---

 Features:-

- Clean title preprocessing using regular expressions
- TF-IDF vectorizer to analyze text similarity
- Cosine similarity for ranking similar titles
- Interactive input box for recommendations
- Easily extendable to other content types (e.g., genres, descriptions)

 Dataset:-

This project uses a CSV file (`movies.csv`) that contains a list of movies with a column named `title`.
